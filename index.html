  <hr /> <p>One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of
    multicultural experiences.With a rich heritage and myriad attractions,
    the country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world.
    It covers an area of 32, 87,26 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered
    Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south.As the 7th
    largest country in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia,
    marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the
    country a distinct geographical entity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and
      at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the
      Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you travel
      the expanse of the country, you are greeted by diverse nuances of cuisines,
      faiths, arts, crafts, music, nature, lands, tribes, history and adventure
      sports. India has a mesmeric conflation of the old and the new. As the
      bustling old bazaars rub shoulders with swanky shopping malls, and majestic
      monuments accompany luxurious heritage hotels, the quintessential traveller
      can get the best of both worlds. Head to the mountains, enjoy a beach
      retreat or cruise through the golden Thar, India has options galore for all.
